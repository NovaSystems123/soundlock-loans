## Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract SoundLockLoans {
    // FHE-encrypted data structures
    struct LoanApplication {
        euint32 requestedAmount;
        euint32 loanTerm;
        euint32 creditScore;
        // ... other encrypted fields
    }
    
    // Key functions with FHE encryption
    function submitLoanApplication(...) external;
    function makeRepayment(...) external;
    function registerMusicIP(...) external;
}
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Wallet connection with RainbowKit
const { submitLoanApplication, registerMusicIP } = useSoundLockContract();

// FHE-encrypted loan application
const handleLoanApplication = async () => {
    const encryptedAmount = FHE.encrypt(requestedAmount);
    await submitLoanApplication.writeAsync({
        args: [musicIPHash, applicantName, encryptedAmount, ...]
    });
};
```
